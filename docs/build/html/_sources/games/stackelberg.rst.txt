The user controls the leader, represented as the row player in the game. In each round, the leader selects a strategy, followed by the follower's response based on a user-specified behavior mode. The noisy utility feedback obtained by the leader/user when the leader chooses action i and the follower responds with action j is represented by the highlighted cell at coordinate (i, j). A lighter color indicates a higher utility for the user.

The concept of regret is defined as the difference between the Stackelberg leader utility (the maximum utility achievable in a single round if the leader has complete knowledge of the follower's private type) and the actual utility obtained by the user.
