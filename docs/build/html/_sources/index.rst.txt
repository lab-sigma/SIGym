=================================

Strategic IntelliGence Gym is a Python library for developing and testing different learning algorithms in game-theoretic environments. The library implements a variety of commonly studied game-theoretic setups (from foundational economic models to critical real-world applications) and strategic opponent response mechanisms (rational or boundedly rational). The user can use the implemented API to test their learning algorithms by setting up customized game environments.
