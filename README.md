Strategic Interation Gym is a Python library for developing and exploring different algorithms for strategically interacting in game theoretic settings.
It aims to provide implementations of a variety of common environments and response mechanisms as well as an API for setting up custom environments and
algorithms.

Ported utilities/algorithmic implementations from here: https://github.com/lab-sigma/dynamic-stackelberg

You will need Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/) to run the code. Licenses can be obtained for free for academic purposes.
